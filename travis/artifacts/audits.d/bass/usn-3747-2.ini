vuln-short-description = "USN-3747-1 introduced a regression in OpenJDK 10."
vuln-long-description = USN-3747-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 10 for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
	Unfortunately, that update introduced a regression around accessability
	support that prevented some Java applications from starting.
	This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience. Original advisory details: It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly validate types in some
	 situations. An attacker could use this to construct a Java class that could
	 possibly bypass sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2018-2825, CVE-2018-2826) It was discovered that the PatternSyntaxException class in OpenJDK did not
	 properly validate arguments passed to it. An attacker could use this to
	 potentially construct a class that caused a denial of service (excessive
	 memory consumption). (CVE-2018-2952) Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered a vulnerability in the Galois/Counter Mode
	 (GCM) mode of operation for symmetric block ciphers in OpenJDK. An attacker
	 could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2018-2972) Update instructions The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions: 
	Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
	openjdk-11-jdk - 10.0.2+13-1ubuntu0.18.04.2
