This update\nprovides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM and Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.\n\nOriginal advisory details:\n\n It was discovered that python-apt would still use MD5 hashes to validate\n certain downloaded packages. If a remote attacker were able to perform a\n man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be used to install\n altered packages. (CVE-2019-15795)\n\n It was discovered that python-apt could install packages from untrusted\n repositories, contrary to expectations. (CVE-2019-15796)\n\n\nTLDR: In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.\n\n",
