    "vuln-long-description": "USN-4228-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n14.04 ESM.\n\nIt was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell\nWiFi-Ex Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901)\n\nIt was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell\nLibertas WLAN Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897)\n\nAnthony Steinhauser discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly\nperform Spectre_RSB mitigations to all processors for PowerPC architecture\nsystems in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2019-18660)\n\nIt was discovered that Geschwister Schneider USB CAN interface driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure\nconditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19052)\n\nIt was discovered that the driver for memoryless force-feedback input\ndevices in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nphysically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19524)\n\nIt was discovered that the PEAK-System Technik USB driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly sanitize memory before sending it to the device. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-19534)\n\n\nTLDR: After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\n\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.\nUnless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages\n(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,\nlinux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform\nthis as well.\n\n",
