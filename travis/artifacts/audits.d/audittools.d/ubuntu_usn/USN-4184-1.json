A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-11135)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics chipsets allowed userspace\nto modify page table entries via writes to MMIO from the Blitter Command\nStreamer and expose kernel memory information. A local attacker could use\nthis to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate privileges.\n(CVE-2019-0155)\n\nDeepak Gupta discovered that on certain Intel processors, the Linux kernel\ndid not properly perform invalidation on page table updates by virtual\nguest operating systems. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to\ncause a denial of service (host system crash). (CVE-2018-12207)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics chipsets could cause a\nsystem hang when userspace performed a read from GT memory mapped input\noutput (MMIO) when the product is in certain low power states. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-0154)\n\nHui Peng discovered that the Atheros AR6004 USB Wi-Fi device driver for the\nLinux kernel did not properly validate endpoint descriptors returned by the\ndevice. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash). (CVE-2019-15098)\n\nJann Horn discovered a reference count underflow in the shiftfs\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2019-15791)\n\nJann Horn discovered a type confusion vulnerability in the shiftfs\nimplementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to\ncause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary\ncode. (CVE-2019-15792)\n\nJann Horn discovered that the shiftfs implementation in the Linux kernel\ndid not use the correct file system uid/gid when the user namespace of a\nlower file system is not in the init user namespace. A local attacker could\nuse this to possibly bypass DAC permissions or have some other unspecified\nimpact. (CVE-2019-15793)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the AX25 network protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local attacker\ncould use this to create a raw socket. (CVE-2019-17052)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Rate Wireless network\nprotocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform\npermissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.\n(CVE-2019-17053)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the Appletalk network protocol implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local\nattacker could use this to create a raw socket. (CVE-2019-17054)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the modular ISDN network protocol implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local\nattacker could use this to create a raw socket. (CVE-2019-17055)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the Near field Communication (NFC) network\nprotocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform\npermissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.\n(CVE-2019-17056)\n\nNico Waisman discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Realtek Wi-Fi\ndriver for the Linux kernel when handling Notice of Absence frames. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-17666)\n\n\nTLDR: Please note that mitigating the TSX (CVE-2019-11135) and i915\n(CVE-2019-0154) issues requires corresponding microcode and graphics\nfirmware updates respectively.\n\nAfter a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\n\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.\nUnless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages\n(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,\nlinux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform\nthis as well.\n\n",
