    "vuln-long-description": "USN-4255-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n16.04 LTS.\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data\nstructures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A\nlocal attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2019-14615)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition can lead to a use-after-free while\ndestroying GEM contexts in the i915 driver for the Linux kernel. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or\npossibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-7053)\n\n\nTLDR: After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\n\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.\nUnless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages\n(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,\nlinux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform\nthis as well.\n\n",
