A local attacker\ncould use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2019-11135)\n\nDeepak Gupta discovered that on certain Intel processors, the Linux kernel\ndid not properly perform invalidation on page table updates by virtual\nguest operating systems. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to\ncause a denial of service (host system crash). (CVE-2018-12207)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the AX25 network protocol implementation in the\nLinux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local attacker\ncould use this to create a raw socket. (CVE-2019-17052)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Rate Wireless network\nprotocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform\npermissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.\n(CVE-2019-17053)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the Appletalk network protocol implementation in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local\nattacker could use this to create a raw socket. (CVE-2019-17054)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the modular ISDN network protocol implementation\nin the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local\nattacker could use this to create a raw socket. (CVE-2019-17055)\n\nOri Nimron discovered that the Near field Communication (NFC) network\nprotocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform\npermissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.\n(CVE-2019-17056)\n\n\nTLDR: Please note that mitigating the TSX (CVE-2019-11135) issue requires\na corresponding Intel processor microcode update.\n\nAfter a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\n\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.\nUnless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages\n(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,\nlinux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform\nthis as well.\n\n",
