    "vuln-long-description": "USN-4225-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 19.10.\nThis update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware\nEnablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 19.10 for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n\nIt was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell\nWiFi-Ex Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901)\n\nIt was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell\nLibertas WLAN Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897)\n\nIt was discovered that the Fujitsu ES network device driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly check for errors in some situations, leading to a\nNULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service. (CVE-2019-16231)\n\nAnthony Steinhauser discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly\nperform Spectre_RSB mitigations to all processors for PowerPC architecture\nsystems in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2019-18660)\n\nIt was discovered that the Mellanox Technologies Innova driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure conditions. A\nlocal attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-19045)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel WiMAX 2400 driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2019-19051)\n\nIt was discovered that Geschwister Schneider USB CAN interface driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure\nconditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19052)\n\nIt was discovered that the netlink-based 802.11 configuration interface in\nthe Linux kernel did not deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel\nmemory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19055)\n\nIt was discovered that the event tracing subsystem of the Linux kernel did\nnot properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-19072)\n\nIt was discovered that the driver for memoryless force-feedback input\ndevices in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nphysically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19524)\n\nIt was discovered that the Microchip CAN BUS Analyzer driver in the Linux\nkernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability on device disconnect. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19529)\n\nIt was discovered that the PEAK-System Technik USB driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly sanitize memory before sending it to the device. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-19534)\n\nIt was discovered that the DesignWare USB3 controller driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly deallocate memory in some error conditions. A local\nattacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory\nexhaustion). (CVE-2019-18813)\n\n\nTLDR: After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\n\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.\nUnless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages\n(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,\nlinux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform\nthis as well.\n\n",
