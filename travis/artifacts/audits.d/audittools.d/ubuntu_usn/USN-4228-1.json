A physically proximate attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901)\n\nIt was discovered that a heap-based buffer overflow existed in the Marvell\nLibertas WLAN Driver for the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly\nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897)\n\nAnthony Steinhauser discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly\nperform Spectre_RSB mitigations to all processors for PowerPC architecture\nsystems in some situations. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information. (CVE-2019-18660)\n\nIt was discovered that Geschwister Schneider USB CAN interface driver in\nthe Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain failure\nconditions. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19052)\n\nIt was discovered that the driver for memoryless force-feedback input\ndevices in the Linux kernel contained a use-after-free vulnerability. A\nphysically proximate attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (system crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-19524)\n\nIt was discovered that the PEAK-System Technik USB driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly sanitize memory before sending it to the device. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to expose sensitive\ninformation (kernel memory). (CVE-2019-19534)\n\n\nTLDR: After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\n\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.\nUnless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages\n(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,\nlinux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform\nthis as well.\n\n",
