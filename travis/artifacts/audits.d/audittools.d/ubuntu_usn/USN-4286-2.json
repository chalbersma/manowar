    "vuln-long-description": "USN-4286-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04\nLTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux\nHardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu\n14.04 ESM.\n\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data\nstructures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A\nlocal attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.\n(CVE-2019-14615)\n\nIt was discovered that a race condition existed in the Softmac USB Prism54\ndevice driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could\nuse this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2019-15220)\n\nJulien Grall discovered that the Xen balloon memory driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly restrict the amount of memory set aside for page\nmappings in some situations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial\nof service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-17351)\n\nIt was discovered that the Intel WiMAX 2400 driver in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).\n(CVE-2019-19051)\n\nIt was discovered that the Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local\nattacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel\nmemory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19056)\n\nIt was discovered that the Brocade BFA Fibre Channel device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19066)\n\nIt was discovered that the Realtek RTL8xxx USB Wi-Fi device driver in the\nLinux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error\nconditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of\nservice (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-19068)\n\nGao Chuan discovered that the SAS Class driver in the Linux kernel\ncontained a race condition that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A\nlocal attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system\ncrash). (CVE-2019-19965)\n\nIt was discovered that the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)\nimplementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in\ncertain error conditions. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a\ndenial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). (CVE-2019-20096)\n\nMitchell Frank discovered that the Wi-Fi implementation in the Linux kernel\nwhen used as an access point would send IAPP location updates for stations\nbefore client authentication had completed. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-5108)\n\nIt was discovered that ZR364XX Camera USB device driver for the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory. A physically proximate attacker\ncould use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).\n(CVE-2019-15217)\n\nIt was discovered that the Line 6 POD USB device driver in the Linux kernel\ndid not properly validate data size information from the device. A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash). (CVE-2019-15221)\n\n\nTLDR: After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make\nall the necessary changes.\n\nATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have\nbeen given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and\nreinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.\nUnless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages\n(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,\nlinux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform\nthis as well.\n\n",
