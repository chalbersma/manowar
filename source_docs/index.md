# Man o' War

## Introduction

Man o' War has a goal of collecting more data, allowing historical lookbacks, and
providing a more flexible auditing solution. Additionally it has a goal of having
a somewhat flexible model for metadata storage so that future collection and analysis 
needs can be met.

It was based of a project VDMS named called Jellyfish (it should be seen as an
opensourced fork of the project). There are name references to it all over the
place so keep that in mind.
